# Table Talks — TODO and ideas

## Ideas / improvements

- **Favorites / Bookmark Questions** — Let users save interesting questions to a favorites list. Add `/favorites` command to view saved questions later.
- **For users to suggest questions** — Let users submit new question ideas (e.g. a command or button "Suggest a question") and store them (file, sheet, or queue) for the owner to review and add to the deck.
- **Admin commands** — Optional `/stats` or `/broadcast` for the owner (e.g. how many chats, send a message to all); protect with a user-id allowlist.
